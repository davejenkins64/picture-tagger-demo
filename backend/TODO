package so to run with gunicorn?

make sure or set media-type to application/vnd.api+json.

change json output to have a "links" section and a "data" section.
links is a url to first, prev, next, last.
could status be in a "meta" section?

tuturoial assumes the first, prev, next, last values are in the 
Links: header, but JSON:API says they are in the body.

query string should contain page[size], page[first], page[before], page[after],
page[last] etc.  This one is tough with webargs because python will think
it is an array?

Make the tags buttons with a x in them to remove them by clicking on them.

Hook up the back-end to allow patch to change tags (or post)?

Each picture should be a hash/dictionary of name value pairs and not an array.
this will change the front end too.

need a way to remember the range they specify and the current page in it.
no range defaults to 0000:00 to 9999:99, and they can specify one or the 
other or both

DEFER: need also to remember the filter in affect.
but perhaps don't bother filtering now?

If they reset the range, keep the filter
if they reset the filter, keep the range
